Use our API for your own developments and mash-ups, or visit our physical 'hubs' - playgrounds for using and experimenting with digital collections from Europe's museums, galleries, libraries and archives. With the Europeana API, you can access the collections and incorporate them into things like apps, games, websites, even creating mash-ups using other APIs. The possibilities really are endless. Here we highlight just some of the collections you can find through Europeana - explore them through the Europeana portal or directly through the API console. The Europeana API allows you to build applications, websites and mash-ups that include a customised view of Europeana content. You choose how much information is shown, where, and in what format. To start developing your own applications, register for an API key.
